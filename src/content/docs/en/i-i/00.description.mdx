:::tip
It is recommended to switch to [the new Quickshell version](../../ii-qs/00description/), which has much better performance, at the cost of losing some niche customizations and higher memory usage.
:::

:::caution
The AGS version of illogical impulse is no longer supported.

Although it may still work you'll have to deal with problems by yourself.

New issue about AGS version will very likely get closed as not planned.
